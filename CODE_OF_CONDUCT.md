# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide transparency, and encourage contribution through conversation. To facilitate these goals, we need to commit to a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone.

This code of conduct outlines my expectations for all those who participate in our community on GitHub, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

I invite everyone who participates in this repository to help create a safe and positive experience for everyone.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, I want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The same behaviors established on the fan server is expected here, in adition to:

* Collaborating constructively to resolve conflicts.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The rules established on the fan server are expected here.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from anyone, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If I deem a member is engaging in unacceptable behavior, I will attempt to correct caused damages, and take preventative measures. Preventative measures may include up to, a permenant ban without warning.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact me as soon as possible.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.
